## Design Decisions and AI Usage

  ### Design Decisions

    Component-based Structure - Modular components for reusability and easier maintenance

    Custom Hooks - Separated data fetching logic from UI components for cleaner code organization and reusability

    In-memory Caching - Used JavaScript Map instead of an external cache library to minimize dependencies

    Responsive Grid - Mobile-first approach and use of grid to create a responsive app for optimal viewing across different viewports

    API Response Caching - Cached API responses to reduce network requests and improve load times

    Memoized Computations - Used useMemo for filtering operations to prevent unnecessary recalculations

  ### AI Usage

    Analyzed the UI requirements and broke down the interface into logical, reusable components before writing any code,
    resulting in a clear component hierarchy. Leveraged Claude to generate boilerplate code for the identified components
    with pre-configured Tailwind CSS classes, significantly accelerating development
    and giving more time to focus on the core logic of the project.
  
## Summary

    Completed the project within the expected time limit of 90 mins by analyzing assignment requirements and identifying core features.
    Designing component hierarchy and data flow at the start helped break the task into a set of different subtasks 
    and it felt like adding missing puzzle pieces in the boiler plate code.
